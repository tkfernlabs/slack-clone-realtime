# Issue Fixes - Slack Clone Application

## Date: 2024

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Audio Call Connection Issue ✅
**Problem:** 
- When initiating a call, it would request microphone access but wouldn't actually connect to the other user
- WebRTC signaling was incomplete due to missing recipient ID in ICE candidate exchange

**Solution:**
- Updated `webrtc.ts` to properly store recipient ID when initiating a call
- Added comprehensive logging to track WebRTC signaling flow
- Fixed ICE candidate exchange by ensuring target user ID is available
- Added 'connecting' state to properly track call establishment

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/services/webrtc.ts
- Store recipient ID when initiating call
- Add 'call:initiated' event listener
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- Added 'connecting' state to CallState type
```

### 2. Direct Messages Not Showing in Sidebar ✅
**Problem:**
- DMs weren't appearing in the sidebar after they were created
- The DM list wasn't refreshing when new messages were sent

**Solution:**
- Added socket event listeners to automatically refresh DM list
- Implemented periodic refresh (every 30 seconds) as fallback
- Connected socket events to DM list updates

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/Workspace/Sidebar.tsx
- Added socket.io import and event listeners
- Listen for 'new_message' events to refresh DM list
- Added auto-refresh interval for DM list
- Handle 'dm_created' event for immediate updates
```

### 3. Thread Messages Not Updating in Real-Time ✅
**Problem:**
- When sending a message in a thread, it wouldn't appear until page refresh
- Thread view wasn't using real-time socket connections

**Solution:**
- Updated thread message sending to use Socket.IO instead of HTTP API
- Messages now appear instantly through WebSocket events

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/Workspace/ThreadView.tsx
- Modified handleSendReply to use socketService.sendMessage()
- Real-time updates now handled through existing socket listeners
```

## Backend Improvements

### Enhanced Call Handlers
- Added comprehensive logging for call initiation and WebRTC signaling
- Better error handling with detailed error messages
- Improved recipient online status checking

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// backend/callHandlers.js
- Added console.log statements for debugging call flow
- Enhanced error messages with actual error details
- Better tracking of socket connections for users
```

## Testing Guide

### Audio Calls
1. Open the application in two different browser sessions
2. Log in as different users
3. Start a DM conversation
4. Click the phone icon to initiate a call
5. Accept the call in the other browser
6. Verify audio connection is established

### Direct Messages
1. Create a new DM with another user
2. Verify it appears immediately in the sidebar
3. Send messages back and forth
4. Check that the DM list updates with latest message preview

### Thread Updates
1. Open a channel and send a message
2. Click on the message to open thread view
3. Send a reply in the thread
4. Verify the reply appears immediately without refresh

## Deployment Status

- **Backend**: https://slack-backend-morphvm-4yh44846.http.cloud.morph.so

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/tkfernlabs/slack-clone-realtime

## Known Limitations

1. **WebRTC STUN Servers**: Currently using public Google STUN servers. For production, consider adding TURN servers for better connectivity through firewalls.

2. **DM List Ordering**: DMs are ordered by last message time, but this might not update immediately in all cases.

3. **Call Quality**: Audio quality depends on network conditions. No adaptive bitrate implemented yet.

## Future Improvements

1. **Video Calls**: Add video capability to the existing audio call infrastructure
2. **Screen Sharing**: Implement screen sharing during calls
3. **Call History**: Store and display call history in DM conversations
4. **Presence System**: Enhance real-time presence updates
5. **Message Search**: Add full-text search across all messages and threads

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3, Socket.IO Client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (Socket.IO), WebRTC for audio calls
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Neon Cloud

## Commit History

Latest commit: `b60f8c0` - Fix three critical issues:
1. Audio calls now properly connect - fixed WebRTC signaling and recipient ID handling
2. DMs now show up and refresh in sidebar - added socket listeners and auto-refresh
3. Threads now update in real-time - using socket.io for message sending
